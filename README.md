## The Projects Page (Boards)

On the [Projects Page](https://github.com/Free-Code-Camp-Indy/free-code-camp-indy.github.io/projects) there are boards to track development. Here is how they work:

1. **Note** - Quick title of a task that needs to be done
1. **Issue** - Detailed description of what needs to be done. Comments from others regarding the task and what should be done or how it should be done.
1. **Groomed** - If the issue no longer needs to be fleshed out, it is moved to groomed, so people know it's ready to be worked on.
1. **In Progress** - If you see a groomed issues you want to work on, then you assign it to yourself and move it to in progress.
1. **Complete** - When an issue is done it is moved to completed.
